# Simple Kernel Driver for Drawing Lines and Rectangles

This is a simple kernel driver project that allows developers to draw lines and rectangles on a PC screen by calling functions defined in the kernel driver. It's designed to be used with Visual Studio 2022, making it easy to integrate into your existing development workflow.

## Features

- **Draw Lines**: Use the provided functions to draw lines on the screen. You can specify the coordinates, color, and line thickness.

- **Draw Rectangles**: Draw rectangles with ease, defining the position, dimensions, color, and line thickness.

- **Easy Integration**: This kernel driver can be integrated into your Visual Studio 2022 project, making it simple to use for your development needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- Windows Development Environment

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kernel-driver-drawing.git
```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022.

3. Build the project to generate the kernel driver.

4. Install the kernel driver on your system.

5. Use the provided functions in your code to draw lines and rectangles on the screen.

## Usage

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h>

// Include the header file for the kernel driver
#include "kernel_driver.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize the kernel driver
    if (!InitializeKernelDriver()) {
        printf("Failed to initialize the kernel driver.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Example: Draw a red rectangle on the screen
    DrawRectangle(100, 100, 200, 200, RED);

    // Example: Draw a blue line on the screen
    DrawLine(50, 50, 300, 50, BLUE, 3);

    // Uninitialize the kernel driver when done
    UninitializeKernelDriver();

    return 0;
}
```
